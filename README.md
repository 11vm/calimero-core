calimero
========

Core library

This feature branch adapts the Calimero library to take advantage of Java SE Embedded 8. 
The target compact profile is compact1.

Java SE Embedded 8 with the compact1 profile is similar to Java ME CDC and Foundation Profile, 
providing an environment for headless applications on embedded devices that require a small footprint.
